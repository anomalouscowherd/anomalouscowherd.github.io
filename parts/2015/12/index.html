			 <p>This is my blog about the StockFighter on-line programming
      challenge. <a  title="StockFighter online stocktrading/programming game."

         href="https://www.stockfighter.io/">Stockfighter</a> is an online
      programming "game" that requires you to write an automated trading system
      ( or several of them ).&nbsp; This will be a difficult assignment, so I am
      writing this blog to serve as a quick reference and to motivate myself to
      complete the challenge.&nbsp; The blog will almost certainly contain
      spoilers so don't read it if you want to find the answers yourself.&nbsp;
      My technique will evolve as I go along so I don't know what language I
      will write in or what systems I will use.&nbsp; The only thing I am sure
      of is that I do not wish to use any hints or assistance.&nbsp; I have
      almost no experience in programming or stock markets so this will be a
      real education.&nbsp; I expect that it will take me a long time to
      finish.&nbsp; I hope that I will not be the last one to finish the
      challenge, but if I am the last one, then I will become "The Last
      StarFighter" ;-)</p>
