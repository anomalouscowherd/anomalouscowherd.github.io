    <p>I'm back after a hectic holiday calendar and a bad flu.  Fortunately in
      the intervening four weeks the platform has become more stable so we
      should be able to make more progress.</p>
    <p>I just read an article about what it takes to be a stock broker at one of
      the biggest brokerage firms on wall street:<a  href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-14/so-you-want-be-citadel-trader-here-are-requirements"

    <p>What caught my eye was the fact that <a  href="sc&amp;q=stockfighter&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">not
        a single one of the 189 participants that have chosen to make their
        github repositories public</a> have decided to write in R.  R
      programming language is a mature and stable language that has an active
      user community. It is listed as one of the "useful" skills in the above
      job description.  Note that the <span  style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">required</span>
      skills are <span  style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>, <span  style="font-weight: bold;">C++</span>,
      and <span  style="font-weight: bold;">Java</span>.  Not a single one of
      the participants chose to write in C or C++ and only 13 of 189 or 6.8%
      chose to write in Java.  In addition if you write in Python ( chosen by
      15% of the participants ) you are considered to be writing in a
      "scripting" language.  This word "scripting" is a pejorative that means
      that you are not writing a "real" program.  It is somehow not as good as a
      real honest "man's" programming language. This is a slap in the face to
      all the Python, Perl and Bash programmer out there who's collective work
      holds the internet together.  The arrogance and dismissive attitude galls
      me. I have written primarily in Bash for many years and I consider my work
      to be professional and of tremendous value.  </p>

    <p>One might conclude that the participants either do not wish to be hired,
      or think that their skill in other languages will be thought fungible. In
      light of the fact that the Stockfighter challenge bills itself as a job
      placement web site, I have to conclude the latter.  My experience with
      human resource departments at large institutions is that they are
      inflexible and frankly incompetent. They cannot make a determination about
      the technical skills or conversely the trainability of candidates. In
      general if you know one language it is pretty easy to pick up another one
      in a matter of weeks.  The current buzz word is "Object Orientation" and
      the job description mentions only C++ and Java as candidate OO languages.
      Given the huge academic and industry move to Java as a standard over the
      last 15 years or so I think it is a given that they are only looking for
      skill in Java and most likely specifically Hibernate + Spring + Maven or
      Java EE with all the trimmings.  These frameworks take years to learn and
      genuinely are not fungible skills. Moreover, this type of programming
      damages your brain making you incapable of writing small efficient
      programs that can, for instance, trade stocks quickly.  </p>
    <p>À Propos of my previous discussion on the stability and maturity of
      Python; it seems to me that there is an emphasis on Time to Market in the
      brokerage business rather than maintainability. This is the same pressure
      I saw in the advertising industry where a site might be made live for a
      period of a few hours and never used again.  My goal here is to write <a

         href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional
        Programs.</a> To a considerable extent these Programming Paradigms are
      fads that come and go.  Industry has latched on to Object Orientation
      because it allows them to write spaghetti code in a maintainable way.
      Functional programming by it's very nature produces clean
      compartmentalized code without excessive loops or branches.  I wish to
      write in R because it is stable and mature and above all because I can
      write programs quickly in R ( in principle ).  My hope is that citadel
      will be more interested in substance than style.  I think that Functional
      Programming is a desirable, marketable life skill. I leave you with this
      excerpt from the Wikipedia page on <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms">Programming
        paradigms</a>:</p>

        Object-oriented programming is eliminated entirely from the introductory
        curriculum, because it is both anti-modular and anti-parallel by its
        very nature, and hence unsuitable for a modern CS curriculum. A proposed
        new course on object-oriented design methodology will be offered at the
        sophomore level for those students who wish to study this topic.</div>
