<h3 class="title">View From Mount Stupid</h3>
<div class="item-description">I was dealing with family issues most
of yesterday and today, but I am still plugging away at this.<br />
<br />
I am now in my third day of the StockFighter challenge. two days
ago you might recall, I managed to get the automated web browser
httpie installed but it seems to have some problems with SSL.&#160;
I will spend a few cycles resolving those issues, but for the time
being I want to focus on the other method mentioned in the API
guide using the ruby language. Ruby is an interesting language. It
was developed in Japan and the main developers speak
Japanese.&#160; Some of the discussion on the forums is exclusively
in Japanese.&#160; This would not bother me if the language was in
a stable condition, like for instance C language, but it is
not.&#160; Ruby is in active development 20 years after it was
released.&#160; Some people call this "remaining relevant". I call
it gratuitous fluff.&#160; So, back to the challenge. The ruby
program to handle the first trade is <a href=
"https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/getting-started">here</a>:<br />

<a title="https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/getting-started" href=

<br />
So I'm making progress.&#160; I'm wondering how many people will
choose to fight this octopus to get to the stage of being able to
launch an order.&#160; I feel like I am junking up my machine and
introducing security holes so I can run some idiosyncratic garbage
that will be replaced in a few days.&#160; That is not a
exaggeration. Ruby 2.2.4 was released Dec. 16, 2015.&#160; You can
bet that most of those "gems" will need to be re-written to
cope.&#160; The last version of C was released in 2011.&#160; If
you where a C programmer you might not have noticed.&#160; The C
language is standardized ( via ANSI in 1989 or ISO in 1990 ).&#160;
Your programs would continue to work without rewrites.<br />
<br />
I read an article yesterday about <a href=
"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-19/2015-year-review-scenic-vistas-mount-stupid">
Mount Stupid</a>:<br />
<img alt="mount stupid" src="../images/mount-stupid.jpg" /><br />
<br />
The premise is that people that know nothing about a subject will
broadcast their ignorance to the world.&#160; So I am just climbing
the front side of Mount Stupid right now.&#160; I expect the decent
to be a long trip so you can expect to hear from me for a long
time.<br />

<h3 class="title">First Day and First Level</h3>
<div class="item-description">
<p>If you are making a game about programming, it seems to me that
you should make it as accessible as possible. This is not a rant. I
know next to nothing about programming and if someone introduces me
to a new tool I don't reject it out of hand. However the very first
level introduces me to the StockFighter API with this text:</p>
<p><a ng-click="choose($index)" href=
"https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/place-new-order"><span ng-if=
"!tab.status" class="ng-scope ng-binding">Shell</span></a></p>
<div ng-show="$index==current" ng-repeat=
"tab in data.codes track by $id($index)" class="ng-scope">
<pre data-mode="shell" class="cm-s-neo c2" ng-if=
"data.codes[$index].code != &quot;&quot;">
<span class=
"cm-comment"># Let's try something different this time.  Sure, you could interact with the API</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># in an actual programming language, but let me introduce you to httpie, a very</span>
<span class="cm-comment"># cool tool.</span>

<span class=
"cm-comment"># httpie is like curl, except much nicer to use.  See: https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie</span>

<span class="cm-comment"># You can install it via: </span>
<span class="cm-comment"># brew install httpie</span>
<span class="cm-comment"># apt-get install httpie</span>
<span class="cm-comment"># yum install httpie</span>

<span class=
"cm-comment"># We'll start by creating a file representing our JSON request, like:</span>

<span class="cm-def">$ nano</span> /tmp/order.json

<span class="cm-comment"># Copy/paste in:</span>

{
  <span class="cm-string">"account"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"MST92145671"</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"venue"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"LOBHEX"</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"stock"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"LPEI"</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"qty"</span>: <span class=
"cm-number">100</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"direction"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"buy"</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"orderType"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"market"</span> 
}

<span class=
"cm-comment"># Got that ready?  Great, here's httpie magic:</span>

<span class=
"cm-def">$ http</span> POST https://api.stockfighter.io/ob/api/venues/LOBHEX/stocks/LPEI/orders <span class="cm-string">'X-Starfighter-Authorization:copy-and-paste-your-API-key-here'</span> &lt; /tmp/order.json

<span class=
"cm-comment"># Now isn't that so much nicer than curl?</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># No unnecessary headers (the Accept: application/json is implict.)</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># You can inspect the requests quickly, with syntax highlighting.</span>

<span class=
"cm-comment"># This is frequently useful when you're exploring a novel API.  Try it out!</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># Most developers, after they get a handle on the endpoints, will want to</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># write a more robust program in their language of choice, but httpie is</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># a good choice for interactive programming when you want to figure out</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># exactly what is happening when e.g. a library isn't working as expected.<br /><br /></span> 
</pre></div>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cool Right? I just put together a new virtual machine and got
this blog software working. Now I want to try this API thingy so
lets Fire up that httpie and see what happens!</p>
<p><code>[root@sl7-vm ~]# yum install httpie<br />
Loaded plugins: langpacks<br />
No package httpie available.<br />
Error: Nothing to do</code></p>
<p>So I'm not easily dissuaded. I check out the web site <a href=
"https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie" title=
"HTTPIE cURL type program">here.</a></p>
<p>It says you can use something called "pip" if your favorite yum
repo doesn't happen to have hippie in it. Let's try that:</p>
<p><code>[root@sl7-vm ~]# pip<br />
-bash: pip: command not found</code></p>
<p>Hummm....</p>

<p>So what happened there? It looks to me like I just installed a
package outside of the rpm database. In general I try to avoid
doing that. It can lead to a situation known as "Dependency Hell".
This was why the yum system was introduced. The intention was to
avoid having to install packages from source. You will note that
the pip package and the httpie package spray files all over the
place. In addition this new POS ( Piece of Software) has introduced
a security vulnerability into my relatively clean box. It is a
pretty minor one, but it is not simple to fix. I am running
<a href="https://www.scientificlinux.org/" title=
"Scientific Linux">Scientific Linux</a>, a RedHat derivative. This
is important because RedHat uses python for all of it's system
software. Leaving aside for the moment advisability of writing
crucial system software in an interpreted language, lets look at
this security issue . The message I get when I try to install
httpie says this:</p>
<p><code>InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not
available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately
and may cause certain SSL connections to fail. For more
information, see <a href=
"https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning"
title="insecure platform warning"><span class=
"c3">https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning</span></a>.</code></p>
<p>The linked page tells me that my version of python needs a tweak
(or three) to handle HTTPS requests. The recommended fix is to
"upgrade" python to version 2.7.9 ( am running Python 2.7.5 ). I
downloaded this OS today. It still has that new car smell. I will
not "upgrade" python.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Long story short, This is a crappy tool. Why didn't you show an
example using the tools that come with the OS? In my case that
includes wget, cURL and ... what else? elinks maybe? There is
another example on the page that uses ruby. I will write about that
next time.</p>

<p>This is my blog about the StockFighter on-line programming
challenge. <a title=
"StockFighter online stocktrading/programming game." href=
"https://www.stockfighter.io/">Stockfighter</a> is an online
programming "game" that requires you to write an automated trading
system ( or several of them ).&#160; This will be a difficult
assignment, so I am writing this blog to serve as a quick reference
and to motivate myself to complete the challenge.&#160; The blog
will almost certainly contain spoilers so don't read it if you want
to find the answers yourself.&#160; My technique will evolve as I
go along so I don't know what language I will write in or what
systems I will use.&#160; The only thing I am sure of is that I do
not wish to use any hints or assistance.&#160; I have almost no
experience in programming or stock markets so this will be a real
education.&#160; I expect that it will take me a long time to
finish.&#160; I hope that I will not be the last one to finish the
challenge, but if I am the last one, then I will become "The Last
StarFighter" ;-)</p>
