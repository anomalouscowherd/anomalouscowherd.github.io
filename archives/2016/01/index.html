          <h3 class="title">How to debug encrypted API calls</h3>
          <div class="item-description">
            I am writing this post in the hopes that someone doing a search will find useful information on debugging encrypted API
            calls.<br />
            <br />
            How do you debug a request if the conversation is encrypted?&nbsp; This isn't about figuring what version of TLS the
            server supports.&nbsp; It is about the content of the request not being recognized by the API.<br />
            <br />
            My technique is to intercept the conversation between the browser and the server and try to duplicate a working
            request.&nbsp; You have to have a functioning example API call to make this work, but in this case we have the API docs
            to work with.&nbsp; The example ruby code for a bid or offer is <a title="first-trade.rb" href=
            "https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/getting-started">here:<br />
            https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/getting-started</a><br />
            <br />
            The mechanics of this request can be investigated with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngrep/">ngrep:<br />
            http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngrep/</a><br />

            [root@sl7-vm ngrep-1.45]# autoconf configure.in &gt; configure<br /></code><br />
            Install the prerequisites:<br />
            <code>[root@sl7-vm ngrep-1.45]# yum install libpcap-devel</code><br />
            <br />
            Configure it, build it, and install it:<br />
            <code>[root@sl7-vm ngrep-1.45]# ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code><br />
            <br />
            you should see this:<br />
            <br />
            <code>gcc -g -O2 -DLINUX -DHAVE_CONFIG_H&nbsp; -D_BSD_SOURCE=1 -D__FAVOR_BSD=1&nbsp; -I. -I/usr/include&nbsp; -g -c
            ngrep.c<br />
            gcc -g -O2 -DLINUX -DHAVE_CONFIG_H&nbsp; -D_BSD_SOURCE=1 -D__FAVOR_BSD=1&nbsp; -L/usr/lib -s -o ngrep ngrep.o&nbsp;
            regex-0.12/regex.o -lpcap<br />
            ./install-sh -c -m 0755 ngrep&nbsp; ///bin/ngrep<br />
            ./install-sh -c -m 0644 ngrep.8 ///share/man/man8/ngrep.8<br /></code><br />
            Got to love that autoconf.&nbsp; Three slashes are better than one.<br />
            <br />
            So what do we do with it?&nbsp; This is the tricky part.&nbsp; You are going to need stunnel for this part:<br />
            <code>[root@sl7-vm ~]# yum install stunnel<br /></code><br />
            make a certificate:<br />
            <code>[root@sl7-vm mitm]# openssl req -batch -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out server.pem -keyout
            server.pem</code><br />
            <br />
            now create a config file that looks like this:<br />
            <br />
            <code>[root@sl7-vm mitm]# cat stunnel-mitm-proxy.conf<br />
            debug = 3<br />
            #foreground = yes<br />
            pid =<br />
            <br />
            [server]<br />
            client = no<br />
            cert= ./server.pem<br />
            accept = 127.0.0.1:443<br />
            connect = 127.0.0.1:4434<br />
            <br />
            [client]<br />
            client = yes<br />
            accept = 127.0.0.1:4434<br />
            connect = api.stockfighter.io:443</code><br />
            <br />
            <br />
            This will create a Man In The Middle proxy server that will permit you to inspect traffic that would otherwise be
            end-to-end encrypted.&nbsp; In order to use this proxy server you will need to either change the address you post to in
            your code to 127.0.0.1 or alter the /etc/hosts file like so:<br />
            <code>127.0.0.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; api.stockfighter.io<br /></code><br />
            This looks like something I will forget, so I opted to change my code.<br />
            <br />
            You now need to run the proxy as root:<br />
            <code>stunnel stunnel-mitm-proxy.conf</code><br />
            <br />
            you can now start ngrep like so:<br />
            <code>ngrep -W byline -d lo port 4434</code><br />
            <br />
            This will look like nothing is happening.&nbsp; That is fine just start your request in another window:<br />
            <br />
            <code>[starfighter@sl7-vm stockfighter]$ ruby first-trade.rb<br /></code><br />
            You should see something like this:<br />
            <br />
            <code>#########<br />

            }</code><br />
            <br />
            If you are like me, you tried to do the same thing with wget and you saw this:<br />
            &nbsp;<code>{"ok":false,"error":"json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type main.OrderDesc"}</code><br />
            <br />
            This puzzled me for a bit, but read on for a solution.&nbsp; When I ran my wget command, using what I thought was the
            correct syntax&nbsp; from the man page for wget, I got this in the ngrep window:<br />
            <code>########<br />

            .</code><br />
            <br />
            So I set to work altering my code to look like the functional ruby script:<br />
            <code><br />
            #export base_url="https://api.stockfighter.io/ob/api"<br />
            export base_url="https://127.0.0.1/ob/api"<br />
            <br />
            # Set up the order<br />
            # must look like this:<br />
            #
            {"account":"REDACTED","venue":"AIDEX","symbol":"LPEI","price":5500,"qty":25,"direction":"buy","orderType":"limit"}<br />

            <br />
            export
            order='{"account":"'$account'","venue":"'$venue'","symbol":"'$stock'","price":'$price',"qty":'$qty',"direction":"'$direction'","orderType":"'$orderType'"}'<br />

            export poststring="$base_url/venues/$venue/stocks/$stock/orders"<br />
            #export contect_type="Content-Type: application/json"<br />
            #export headers="X-Starfighter-Authorization: $apikey"<br />
            wget --no-check-certificate --header=$contect_type --header='X-Starfighter-Authorization: '$apikey'' --post-data=$order
            "$poststring"</code><br />
            <br />
            <br />
            That looks pretty gruesome, but it works.&nbsp; This is the result:<br />
            <br />
            <code>&nbsp;{<br />
            &nbsp; "ok": true,<br />

            <p>I'm back after a hectic holiday calendar and a bad flu. Fortunately in the intervening four weeks the platform has
            become more stable so we should be able to make more progress.</p>

            <p>What caught my eye was the fact that <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=stockfighter">not a
            single one of the 189 participants that have chosen to make their github repositories public</a> have decided to write
            in R. R programming language is mature and stable and has an active user community. It is listed as one of the "useful"
            skills in the above job description. Note that the <span class="c2">required</span> skills are <span class=
            "c3">C</span>, <span class="c3">C++</span>, and <span class="c3">Java</span>. Not a single one of the participants
            chose to write in C or C++ and only 13 of 189 or 6.8% chose to write in Java. In addition if you write in Python (
            chosen by 15% of the participants ) you are considered to be writing in a "scripting" language. This word "scripting"
            is a pejorative that means that you are not writing a "real" program. It is somehow not as good as a real honest
            "man's" programming language. This is a slap in the face to all the Python, Perl and Bash programmer out there who's
            collective work holds the internet together. The arrogance and dismissive attitude galls me. I have written primarily
            in Bash for many years and I consider my work to be professional and of tremendous value.</p><img src=
            "../images/languages.png" alt="chart of langages used on github for stockfighter challenge" class="c4" />
            <p>One might conclude that the participants either do not wish to be hired, or think that their skill in other
            languages will be thought fungible. In light of the fact that the Stockfighter challenge bills itself as a job
            placement web site, I have to conclude the latter. My experience with human resource departments at large institutions
            is that they are inflexible and frankly incompetent. They cannot make a determination about the technical skills or
            conversely the trainability of candidates. In general if you know one language it is pretty easy to pick up another one
            in a matter of weeks. The current buzz word is "Object Orientation" and the job description mentions only C++ and Java
            as candidate OO languages. Given the huge academic and industry move to Java as a standard over the last 15 years or so
            I think it is a given that they are only looking for skill in Java and most likely specifically Hibernate + Spring +
            Maven or Java EE with all the trimmings. These frameworks take years to learn and genuinely are not fungible skills.
            Moreover, this type of programming damages your brain making you incapable of writing small efficient programs that
            can, for instance, trade stocks quickly.</p>
            <p>Á Propos of my previous discussion on the stability and maturity of Python; it seems to me that there is an emphasis
            on Time to Market in the brokerage business rather than maintainability. This is the same pressure I saw in the
            advertising industry where web sites are frequently made live for a period of a few hours and never used again. My goal
            here is to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional Programs.</a> To a
            considerable extent these Programming Paradigms are fads that come and go. Industry has latched on to Object
            Orientation because it allows them to write spaghetti code in a maintainable way. Functional programming by it's very
            nature produces clean compartmentalized code without excessive loops or branches. I write in R because it is stable and
            mature and above all because it is a rapid development environment. Functional Programming is a desirable, marketable
            life skill. I leave you with this excerpt from the Wikipedia page on <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms">Programming paradigms</a>:</p>
