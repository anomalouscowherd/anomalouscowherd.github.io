<h3 class="title">Choosing A Language</h3>
<div class="item-description">
<p>I'm back after a hectic holiday calendar and a bad flu.
Fortunately in the intervening four weeks the platform has become
more stable so we should be able to make more progress.</p>
<p>I just read an article about what it takes to be a stock broker
at one of the biggest brokerage firms on wall street:<a href=

<p>Note that "human" trading is not even mentioned in the
posting:</p>

<p>What caught my eye was the fact that <a href=
"sc&amp;q=stockfighter&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">
not a single one of the 189 participants that have chosen to make
their github repositories public</a> have decided to write in R. R
programming language is mature and stable and has an active user
community. It is listed as one of the "useful" skills in the above
job description. Note that the <span class="c2">required</span>
skills are <span class="c3">C</span>, <span class="c3">C++</span>,
and <span class="c3">Java</span>. Not a single one of the
participants chose to write in C or C++ and only 13 of 189 or 6.8%
chose to write in Java. In addition if you write in Python ( chosen
by 15% of the participants ) you are considered to be writing in a
"scripting" language. This word "scripting" is a pejorative that
means that you are not writing a "real" program. It is somehow not
as good as a real honest "man's" programming language. This is a
slap in the face to all the Python, Perl and Bash programmer out
there who's collective work holds the internet together. The
arrogance and dismissive attitude galls me. I have written
primarily in Bash for many years and I consider my work to be
professional and of tremendous value.</p>
<img src="../images/languages.png" alt=
"chart of langages used on github for stockfighter challenge"
class="c4" />
<p>One might conclude that the participants either do not wish to
be hired, or think that their skill in other languages will be
thought fungible. In light of the fact that the Stockfighter
challenge bills itself as a job placement web site, I have to
conclude the latter. My experience with human resource departments
at large institutions is that they are inflexible and frankly
incompetent. They cannot make a determination about the technical
skills or conversely the trainability of candidates. In general if
you know one language it is pretty easy to pick up another one in a
matter of weeks. The current buzz word is "Object Orientation" and
the job description mentions only C++ and Java as candidate OO
languages. Given the huge academic and industry move to Java as a
standard over the last 15 years or so I think it is a given that
they are only looking for skill in Java and most likely
specifically Hibernate + Spring + Maven or Java EE with all the
trimmings. These frameworks take years to learn and genuinely are
not fungible skills. Moreover, this type of programming damages
your brain making you incapable of writing small efficient programs
that can, for instance, trade stocks quickly.</p>
<p>À Propos of my previous discussion on the stability and maturity
of Python; it seems to me that there is an emphasis on Time to
Market in the brokerage business rather than maintainability. This
is the same pressure I saw in the advertising industry where web
sites are frequently made live for a period of a few hours and
never used again. My goal here is to write <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional
Programs.</a> To a considerable extent these Programming Paradigms
are fads that come and go. Industry has latched on to Object
Orientation because it allows them to write spaghetti code in a
maintainable way. Functional programming by it's very nature
produces clean compartmentalized code without excessive loops or
branches. I write in R because it is stable and mature and above
all because it is a rapid development environment. Functional
Programming is a desirable, marketable life skill. I leave you with
this excerpt from the Wikipedia page on <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms">
Programming paradigms</a>:</p>

Object-oriented programming is eliminated entirely from the
introductory curriculum, because it is both anti-modular and
anti-parallel by its very nature, and hence unsuitable for a modern
CS curriculum. A proposed new course on object-oriented design
methodology will be offered at the sophomore level for those
students who wish to study this topic.</p>
