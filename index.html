<h3 class="title">Choosing A Language</h3>
<div class="item-description">
<p>I'm back after a hectic holiday calendar and a bad flu.
Fortunately in the intervening four weeks the platform has become
more stable so we should be able to make more progress.</p>
<p>I just read an article about what it takes to be a stock broker
at one of the biggest brokerage firms on wall street:<a href=

<p>Note that "human" trading is not even mentioned in the
posting:</p>

<br />
<p>What caught my eye was the fact that <a href=
"sc&amp;q=stockfighter&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">
not a single one of the 189 participants that have chosen to make
their github repositories public</a> have decided to write in R. R
programming language is mature and stable and has an active user
community. It is listed as one of the "useful" skills in the above
job description. Note that the <span class="c2">required</span>
skills are <span class="c3">C</span>, <span class="c3">C++</span>,
and <span class="c3">Java</span>. Not a single one of the
participants chose to write in C or C++ and only 13 of 189 or 6.8%
chose to write in Java. In addition if you write in Python ( chosen
by 15% of the participants ) you are considered to be writing in a
"scripting" language. This word "scripting" is a pejorative that
means that you are not writing a "real" program. It is somehow not
as good as a real honest "man's" programming language. This is a
slap in the face to all the Python, Perl and Bash programmer out
there who's collective work holds the internet together. The
arrogance and dismissive attitude galls me. I have written
primarily in Bash for many years and I consider my work to be
professional and of tremendous value.</p>
<img src="../images/languages.png" alt=
"chart of langages used on github for stockfighter challenge"
class="c4" />
<p>One might conclude that the participants either do not wish to
be hired, or think that their skill in other languages will be
thought fungible. In light of the fact that the Stockfighter
challenge bills itself as a job placement web site, I have to
conclude the latter. My experience with human resource departments
at large institutions is that they are inflexible and frankly
incompetent. They cannot make a determination about the technical
skills or conversely the trainability of candidates. In general if
you know one language it is pretty easy to pick up another one in a
matter of weeks. The current buzz word is "Object Orientation" and
the job description mentions only C++ and Java as candidate OO
languages. Given the huge academic and industry move to Java as a
standard over the last 15 years or so I think it is a given that
they are only looking for skill in Java and most likely
specifically Hibernate + Spring + Maven or Java EE with all the
trimmings. These frameworks take years to learn and genuinely are
not fungible skills. Moreover, this type of programming damages
your brain making you incapable of writing small efficient programs
that can, for instance, trade stocks quickly.</p>
<p>À Propos of my previous discussion on the stability and maturity
of Python; it seems to me that there is an emphasis on Time to
Market in the brokerage business rather than maintainability. This
is the same pressure I saw in the advertising industry where a site
might be made live for a period of a few hours and never used
again. My goal here is to write <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional
Programs.</a> To a considerable extent these Programming Paradigms
are fads that come and go. Industry has latched on to Object
Orientation because it allows them to write spaghetti code in a
maintainable way. Functional programming by it's very nature
produces clean compartmentalized code without excessive loops or
branches. I write in R because it is stable and mature and above
all because it is a rapid development environment. Functional
Programming is a desirable, marketable life skill. I leave you with
this excerpt from the Wikipedia page on <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms">
Programming paradigms</a>:</p>

<h3 class="title">View From Mount Stupid</h3>
<div class="item-description">I was dealing with family issues most
of yesterday and today, but I am still plugging away at this.<br />
<br />
I am now in my third day of the StockFighter challenge. two days
ago you might recall, I managed to get the automated web browser
httpie installed but it seems to have some problems with SSL.&#160;
I will spend a few cycles resolving those issues, but for the time
being I want to focus on the other method mentioned in the API
guide using the ruby language. Ruby is an interesting language. It
was developed in Japan and the main developers speak
Japanese.&#160; Some of the discussion on the forums is exclusively
in Japanese.&#160; This would not bother me if the language was in
a stable condition, like for instance C language, but it is
not.&#160; Ruby is in active development 20 years after it was
released.&#160; Some people call this "remaining relevant". I call
it gratuitous fluff.&#160; So, back to the challenge. The ruby
program to handle the first trade is <a href=
"https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/getting-started">here</a>:<br />

<br />
So I'm making progress.&#160; I'm wondering how many people will
choose to fight this octopus to get to the stage of being able to
launch an order.&#160; I feel like I am junking up my machine and
introducing security holes so I can run some idiosyncratic garbage
that will be replaced in a few days.&#160; That is not a
exaggeration. Ruby 2.2.4 was released Dec. 16, 2015.&#160; You can
bet that most of those "gems" will need to be re-written to
cope.&#160; The last version of C was released in 2011.&#160; If
you where a C programmer you might not have noticed.&#160; The C
language is standardized ( via ANSI in 1989 or ISO in 1990 ).&#160;
Your programs would continue to work without rewrites.<br />
<br />
I read an article yesterday about <a href=
"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-19/2015-year-review-scenic-vistas-mount-stupid">
Mount Stupid</a>:<br />
<img alt="mount stupid" src="../images/mount-stupid.jpg" /><br />
<br />
The premise is that people that know nothing about a subject will
broadcast their ignorance to the world.&#160; So I am just climbing
the front side of Mount Stupid right now.&#160; I expect the decent
to be a long trip so you can expect to hear from me for a long
time.<br />

"cm-comment"># in an actual programming language, but let me introduce you to httpie, a very</span>
<span class="cm-comment"># cool tool.</span>

<span class=
"cm-comment"># httpie is like curl, except much nicer to use.  See: https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie</span>

<span class="cm-comment"># You can install it via: </span>
<span class="cm-comment"># brew install httpie</span>
<span class="cm-comment"># apt-get install httpie</span>
<span class="cm-comment"># yum install httpie</span>

<span class=
"cm-comment"># We'll start by creating a file representing our JSON request, like:</span>

<span class="cm-def">$ nano</span> /tmp/order.json

<span class="cm-comment"># Copy/paste in:</span>

{
  <span class="cm-string">"account"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"MST92145671"</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"venue"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"LOBHEX"</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"stock"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"LPEI"</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"qty"</span>: <span class=
"cm-number">100</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"direction"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"buy"</span>,
  <span class="cm-string">"orderType"</span>: <span class=
"cm-string">"market"</span> 
}

<span class=
"cm-comment"># Got that ready?  Great, here's httpie magic:</span>

<span class=
"cm-def">$ http</span> POST https://api.stockfighter.io/ob/api/venues/LOBHEX/stocks/LPEI/orders <span class="cm-string">'X-Starfighter-Authorization:copy-and-paste-your-API-key-here'</span> &lt; /tmp/order.json

<span class=
"cm-comment"># Now isn't that so much nicer than curl?</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># No unnecessary headers (the Accept: application/json is implict.)</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># You can inspect the requests quickly, with syntax highlighting.</span>

<span class=
"cm-comment"># This is frequently useful when you're exploring a novel API.  Try it out!</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># Most developers, after they get a handle on the endpoints, will want to</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># write a more robust program in their language of choice, but httpie is</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># a good choice for interactive programming when you want to figure out</span>
<span class=
"cm-comment"># exactly what is happening when e.g. a library isn't working as expected.<br /><br /></span>

<p>Cool Right? I just put together a new virtual machine and got
this blog software working. Now I want to try this API thingy so
lets Fire up that httpie and see what happens!</p>
<p><code>[root@sl7-vm ~]# yum install httpie<br />
Loaded plugins: langpacks<br />
No package httpie available.<br />
Error: Nothing to do</code></p>
<p>So I'm not easily dissuaded. I check out the web site <a href=
"https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie" title=
"HTTPIE cURL type program">here.</a></p>
<p>It says you can use something called "pip" if your favorite yum
repo doesn't happen to have hippie in it. Let's try that:</p>
<p><code>[root@sl7-vm ~]# pip<br />
-bash: pip: command not found</code></p>
<p>Hummm....</p>
<p><code>[root@sl7-vm ~]# easy_install pip<br />

<p>So what happened there? It looks to me like I just installed a
package outside of the rpm database. In general I try to avoid
doing that. It can lead to a situation known as "Dependency Hell".
This was why the yum system was introduced. The intention was to
avoid having to install packages from source. You will note that
the pip package and the httpie package spray files all over the
place. In addition this new POS ( Piece of Software) has introduced
a security vulnerability into my relatively clean box. It is a
pretty minor one, but it is not simple to fix. I am running
<a href="https://www.scientificlinux.org/" title=
"Scientific Linux">Scientific Linux</a>, a RedHat derivative. This
is important because RedHat uses python for all of it's system
software. Leaving aside for the moment advisability of writing
crucial system software in an interpreted language, lets look at
this security issue . The message I get when I try to install
httpie says this:</p>
<p><code>InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not
available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately
and may cause certain SSL connections to fail. For more
information, see <a href=
"https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning"
title="insecure platform warning"><span class=
"c7">https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning</span></a>.</code></p>
<p>The linked page tells me that my version of python needs a tweak
(or three) to handle HTTPS requests. The recommended fix is to
"upgrade" python to version 2.7.9 ( am running Python 2.7.5 ). I
downloaded this OS today. It still has that new car smell. I will
not "upgrade" python.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Long story short, This is a crappy tool. Why didn't you show an
example using the tools that come with the OS? In my case that
includes wget, cURL and ... what else? elinks maybe? There is
another example on the page that uses ruby. I will write about that
next time.</p>

<div class="item-description">
<p>This is my blog about the StockFighter on-line programming
challenge. <a title=
"StockFighter online stocktrading/programming game." href=
"https://www.stockfighter.io/">Stockfighter</a> is an online
programming "game" that requires you to write an automated trading
system ( or several of them ).&#160; This will be a difficult
assignment, so I am writing this blog to serve as a quick reference
and to motivate myself to complete the challenge.&#160; The blog
will almost certainly contain spoilers so don't read it if you want
to find the answers yourself.&#160; My technique will evolve as I
go along so I don't know what language I will write in or what
systems I will use.&#160; The only thing I am sure of is that I do
not wish to use any hints or assistance.&#160; I have almost no
experience in programming or stock markets so this will be a real
education.&#160; I expect that it will take me a long time to
finish.&#160; I hope that I will not be the last one to finish the
challenge, but if I am the last one, then I will become "The Last
StarFighter" ;-)</p>
